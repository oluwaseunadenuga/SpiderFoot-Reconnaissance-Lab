## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this lab is to simulate the **OSINT reconnaissance phase** of an authorized penetration test or threat intelligence assessment.

Using SpiderFoot's automated scanning engine, I collected and correlated publicly available data about a simulated target organization, identifying:

- Exposed subdomains and DNS records
- Associated corporate email addresses
- Leaked credential references (via HaveIBeenPwned correlation)
- IP reputation intelligence and blacklist presence
- GitHub/Pastebin data leaks
- Technology stack fingerprinting

> ⚠️ **All scans were performed in a controlled, authorized lab environment. No real organizations were targeted.**

This project demonstrates competency in passive reconnaissance techniques applicable to **red team engagements**, **vulnerability assessments**, and **defensive exposure audits**.

## 🔍 Methodology

The engagement followed a structured passive reconnaissance workflow across **four phases**:

| Phase | Activity | Data Collected | SpiderFoot Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| **01** | Target Seeding | Domain name, org name, ASN, IP ranges | `Passive` |
| **02** | Footprinting | Subdomains, DNS records, WHOIS, SSL certs, email addresses | `Footprint` |
| **03** | Threat Intel Correlation | Blacklist presence, breach data, malicious IP flags, dark web mentions | `Investigate` |
| **04** | Analysis & Reporting | Graph visualization, correlation mapping, risk classification | All output formats |

**Approach:**
- **Passive mode** was used first to build a broad intelligence baseline without direct contact with target systems
- **Footprint mode** was applied second to surface deeper technical infrastructure details
- All findings were correlated across multiple data sources for accuracy before classification

---

## 🧩 Modules Used

47 modules were activated across 6 intelligence categories:

| Category | Modules |
|---|---|
| **DNS & Subdomain** | `sfp_dns`, `sfp_sublist3r`, `sfp_hackertarget`, `sfp_crt` |
| **IP & Network** | `sfp_shodan`, `sfp_abuseipdb`, `sfp_spyse` |
| **Threat Intelligence** | `sfp_virustotal`, `sfp_threatcrowd`, `sfp_leakix` |
| **Credential & Breach** | `sfp_haveibeenpwned`, `sfp_pastebin` |
| **Identity & Social** | `sfp_emailformat`, `sfp_linkedin`, `sfp_github` |
| **Web & Certificates** | `sfp_ssl`, `sfp_googlesearch` |

---

## 🚨 Key Findings

> Findings are classified by severity: `CRITICAL` `HIGH` `MEDIUM` `LOW` `INFO`

---

### 🔴 HIGH — Email Addresses in Breach Databases

**Finding:** 4 corporate email addresses were identified in HaveIBeenPwned correlations, indicating potential credential exposure from third-party data breaches. Passwords may be reused across internal systems.

**Module:** `sfp_haveibeenpwned`  
**Risk:** Credential stuffing, unauthorized access  

---

### 🔴 HIGH — Exposed Subdomain with Open Admin Panel

**Finding:** `sfp_hackertarget` identified a subdomain (`admin.target-example.com`) with an accessible login panel responding on port 8080. Not listed in public DNS, but indexed via Certificate Transparency logs.

**Module:** `sfp_hackertarget`, `sfp_crt`  
**Risk:** Brute-force attack surface, unauthorized admin access  

---

### 🟠 MEDIUM — Organisation IP Range Flagged on AbuseIPDB

**Finding:** Two IP addresses within the organisation's ASN netblock appeared in AbuseIPDB with reports of prior malicious activity, suggesting possible historical compromise or hosting abuse.

**Module:** `sfp_abuseipdb`  
**Risk:** IP reputation damage, potential prior compromise  

---

### 🟠 MEDIUM — SSL Certificate Expiry Detected

**Finding:** `sfp_ssl` flagged a subdomain with an SSL certificate expiring within 14 days. Expired certificates trigger browser security warnings and indicate poor certificate lifecycle management.

**Module:** `sfp_ssl`  
**Risk:** Service disruption, loss of user trust  

---

### 🟠 MEDIUM — GitHub Repository Leaking Internal Config

**Finding:** `sfp_github` identified a public repository belonging to an employee containing references to internal staging URLs and a partially redacted API key string.

**Module:** `sfp_github`  
**Risk:** Credential exposure, internal infrastructure disclosure  

---

### 🟡 LOW — 27 Subdomains via Certificate Transparency

**Finding:** `sfp_crt.sh` returned 27 subdomains logged in public CT logs, including dev, staging, and legacy environments — significantly expanding the known attack surface.

**Module:** `sfp_crt`  
**Risk:** Expanded attack surface, subdomain takeover potential  

---

### 🟡 LOW — Pastebin References to Organisation Name

**Finding:** `sfp_pastebin` returned 3 paste entries referencing the organisation name. One entry included internal IP address ranges, likely from a prior employee.

**Module:** `sfp_pastebin`  
**Risk:** Internal network topology disclosure  

---

### 🔵 INFO — Technology Stack Fingerprinted

**Finding:** Server, `X-Powered-By`, and framework response headers revealed the full tech stack: **Apache 2.4 / PHP 8.1 / Laravel**. This information assists in targeting known CVEs during a full penetration test.

**Module:** `sfp_googlesearch`, HTTP header analysis  
**Risk:** Targeted vulnerability exploitation in follow-on engagements

## ✅ Recommendations

| Priority | ID | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Critical | R-01 | **Credential Reset** — Reset all breached email passwords immediately and enforce MFA across SSO and VPN systems |
| 🔴 Critical | R-02 | **Restrict Admin Panel** — Place `admin.target-example.com` behind a VPN gateway or IP allowlist |
| 🟠 High | R-03 | **SSL Certificate Management** — Implement auto-renewal (Let's Encrypt + Certbot) and certificate expiry alerting |
| 🟠 High | R-04 | **GitHub Repository Audit** — Scan all employee public repos for secrets, API keys, and internal URLs using GitHub secret scanning |
| 🟡 Medium | R-05 | **Attack Surface Reduction** — Decommission or restrict unused subdomains; implement DNS monitoring for subdomain takeover |
| 🟡 Medium | R-06 | **HTTP Header Hardening** — Remove or sanitize `Server`, `X-Powered-By`, and framework version headers from all public-facing services |
